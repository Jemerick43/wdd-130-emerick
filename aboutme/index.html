            Hi! I'm currently a computer science major attending Brigham Young
            University, Idaho. I have some history with computers, which dates all the
            way back to when I was as young as ten years old. I've always enjoyed
            using computers for various things, from watching youtube videos to
            playing both "Vanilla" and "Modded" Minecraft (Vanilla being the base
            game, and Modded meaning playing a modified version of the game). As such,
            my time so far at BYUI has been nothing short of inspiring and insightful.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
          for as long as I can remember. However, that doesn't mean that I have
          always believed in God or in Jesus. Through many challenges and
          difficulties that I have faced, I have found slowly but surely that God is
          real, and that He loves all of His children, and it is because of this
          that I hope to one day be the kind of person that He could be proud of.
