          Hi! I'm currently a computer science major attending Brigham Young
          University, Idaho. I have some history with computers, which dates all
          the way back to when I was as young as ten years old. I've always
          enjoyed using computers for various things, from watching youtube
          videos to playing both "Vanilla" and "Modded" Minecraft (Vanilla being
          the base game, and Modded meaning playing a modified version of the
          game). As such, my time so far at BYUI has been nothing short of
          inspiring and insightful.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
          Saints for as long as I can remember. However, that doesn't mean that
          I have always believed in God or in Jesus. Through many challenges and
          difficulties that I have faced, I have found slowly but surely that
          God is real, and that He loves all of His children, and it is because
          of this that I hope to one day be the kind of person that He could be
          proud of.
        </p>
