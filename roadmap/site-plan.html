      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>To be honest, we live in a virtual world. Almost all information is available to anyone with a phone. But we all know that one relative who still
        lives in the 20th century; that one person who has no idea what the “internet” is or what it can do. Wouldn’t it be nice if there were a bootcamp for
        those who are taking their first virtual steps? Well, that’s the purpose of my website; to orient those who tend to become “dis”-oriented on the web.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>If you or a loved one have ever struggled to understand what the internet is, or HOW to navigate/use this powerful and massive resource, this site is for you!</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to this site to learn about the internet. Visitors will learn what the internet
        is, about good web-safe privacy standards, about what the internet has to offer, and how to more
        effectively use a web-browser. Visitors will also learn about information their own computer can
        provide others across the internet, what processes are automatically performed upon visiting a website,
        and the risks associated with such. Visitors will be treated to multiple online activities to teach 
        concepts and ideas which are not readily shown through normal web activity. (Ideas such as web privacy,
        net neutrality, and data collection will all be shared and taught in a simple manner).

      <h3>Safe Surfing</h3>
      <p>
        This page will cover the basics of Web privacy and different solutions to the problem of the data 
        industry. Ideas discussed will include new web-browsers (such as Duck Duck Go), the use of a VPN, 
        and new and upcoming technology to secure all data online (the "For Privacy" project). Page will include
        FAQ's about internet safety such as: "Is my personal information secure on the internet?", "Who has access
        to see what is on my computer", "Is 'hacking' as hard as the movies make it seem?", and so on.

        the concepts of targeted advertisment as well as "packet priority" with regards to the net neutrality
        debate. Companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft, and others will be displayed with 
        data related to revenue related to data collection and how the individual visiting my site plays into
        those statistics.
